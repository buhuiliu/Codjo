[Leo](https://github.com/leotrs), [Serena](https://github.com/sereprz), [Adrien](https://github.com/lamarqua), [Annie](https://github.com/anniecherk) and I are organizing weekly educational coding challenges for [RC Start](https://www.recurse.com/blog/99-free-one-on-one-mentorship-for-new-programmers) folks. Each week we'll gather the participants and put them into pairs. We'll assign a challenge that seems like it will offer good learning opportunities, and we'll practice:

- Collaborating
- Algorithms
- Optimization
- Writing good, clean code

At the end of the week we'll do a live code-review session and try to learn as much as we can from each other.
